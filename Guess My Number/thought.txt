/*
 # decraesing score if guess is wrong
 -first check - if score is number or not 
 -if not, then convert it into number
 -then decrement it by score-- when its too high or too low. 
// this process dont work.we have to declare initial score value


# set high score as equal show score, when showscore is greater than existing high score.
